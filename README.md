# Getting and Cleaning Data â€“ Human Activity Recognition

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This project is part of a learning exercise in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The dataset used comes from experiments conducted with 30 human subjects who performed six different activities while wearing a smartphone equipped with inertial sensors.

The goal of this project was to:
- Merge the training and test datasets.
- Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
- Use descriptive activity names instead of numeric codes.
- Label the dataset with descriptive variable names.
- Create a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code and step-by-step explanation.
- `tidy_dataset.txt`: Final tidy dataset as required.
- `CodeBook.md`: Contains a description of the variables, the data, and all transformations.
